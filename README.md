ðŸŽµ Project 1: "VibeSync" (Your Social Music App)
The Concept: A social platform where users upload their music, create listening rooms with friends, and discover new people with similar tastes. Think of it as a personal, shareable music library meets a real-time chat room.

Key Features to Build:

User Authentication: Secure user signup and login (e.g., using JSON Web Tokens - JWT).

Profile Page: A space for users to see their uploaded tracks, playlists, and a "taste profile" based on their music.

Music Upload & Storage: Users upload audio files. You'll store the file metadata (song title, artist, etc.) in MongoDB and the actual audio files in a cloud service like Cloudinary or AWS S3. (Using a service like S3 is a huge plus on a resume!)

Real-time Listening Rooms: This is the core "showoff" feature. Use Socket.IO to create rooms where multiple users can listen to the same song simultaneously, synchronized in real-time. Add a chat feature to the room so they can talk about the music.

Music Discovery: Create a simple algorithm to match users. For example, if User A and User B both have 5 songs from the same artist, suggest they connect.

Tech Stack Breakdown:

Core: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)

File Storage: Cloudinary or AWS S3

Real-time Communication: Socket.IO

Optional: A library like music-metadata-browser to automatically pull metadata (artist, album art) from the uploaded audio files.
